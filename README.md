## Tech Stacks

- HTML
- CSS

## How it works

- The web page has a search box and a search button where the user can enter their search query.
- The web page also has a list of search results where the matching items are displayed as links with descriptions.
- The web page uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the user interface and perform the search logic.
- The web page uses a sample data array as the source of information, which can be modified or replaced with a real database or API.
- The web page performs a case-insensitive search on the title and description of each item in the data array, and filters out the ones that do not contain the query.
- The web page displays the filtered results as list items, with the title as a link to the URL and the description as a paragraph below it.
- The web page updates the search results whenever the user types in the search box or clicks on the search button.
- The web page shows a message "No results found." if there are no matching items for the query.
